About Zend_Mend
===============

A project to collect some classes we often use in ZendFramework projects. The
name is probably more crass than it needs to be. We don't see this project as
fixing anything in ZF, but rather adding a collection of classes we tend to
rely on. In particular, these are not vetted against the rigorous standards
of the ZF team, though we try to not be sloppy about things :)

Browse, modify, enjoy.

Some things included:
---------------------
* XHTML MIME-Type Negotiation (modified from [Richard Knop](http://blog.richardknop.com/2010/07/zend-framework-content-negotiation-plugin/))
* The beginnings of a full suite of Zend_Form_Elements for HTML5
* A geocoder service
* Some validators for US currency, US telephone numbers, and URLs
* A UUID generator (based on http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.uniqid.php#94959)
